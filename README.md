### ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/599e6b67-8f7f-4cf0-8528-a6cb6314955e)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of vulnerability scanning and remediation, key steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. Using Nessus Essentials, I conducted credentialed vulnerability scans on local virtual machines hosted on VMware Workstation. The lab covered the complete cycle‚Äîfrom identifying vulnerabilities through the initial scan to implementing remediation measures and verifying effectiveness through a rescan. 
In this lab:
- Set up a virtual environment using **VMware Workstation**.
- Conduct **credentialed vulnerability scans** with **Nessus Essentials**.
- Identify, remediate, and rescan to verify remediation of vulnerabilities.

This lab is perfect for building practical experience, especially if you're pursuing a role in vulnerability management.

## Executive Summary
This report outlines a hands-on vulnerability management assessment conducted using **Nessus Essentials**. The primary objective was to simulate a real-world scenario for discovering and remediating vulnerabilities in a controlled virtual environment using **Windows 10** hosted in **VMWare Player**.

### Key Highlights:
- Utilized **Nessus Essentials** to perform credentialed and non-credentialed vulnerability scans.
- Installed outdated software (Firefox) to assess the impact of vulnerable applications.
- Disabled endpoint firewalls to evaluate their role in the system's security posture.
- Successfully remediated vulnerabilities to improve security posture and verified results with follow-up scans.

## Scan Results and Analysis

### 1. Initial Scan Before Installing Deprecated Firefox
The first scan was conducted after setting up the Windows 10 VM and ensuring basic connectivity. No deprecated software or configuration changes were made at this point.

#### Key Observations:
- **Vulnerability Severity Breakdown**:
  | Severity Level | Count  | Percentage |
  | -------------- | ------ | ---------- |
  | üü• **Critical** | 1      | 3%         |
  | üüß **High**     | 0      | 0%         |
  | üü® **Medium**   | 30     | 97%        |
  | üü© **Low**      | 0      | 0%         |

- **Scan Duration**: 8 minutes

The initial scan provided a baseline for the system‚Äôs vulnerabilities, primarily focusing on minor configuration issues.

### 2. Scan After Installing Deprecated Firefox
After installing a deprecated version of **Firefox**, a follow-up scan was conducted to assess the impact.

#### Key Observations:
- **Vulnerability Severity Breakdown**:
  | Severity Level | Count  | Percentage |
  | -------------- | ------ | ---------- |
  | üü• **Critical** | 56     | 28%        |
  | üüß **High**     | 119    | 59%        |
  | üü® **Medium**   | 25     | 13%        |
  | üü© **Low**      | 0      | 0%         |

- **Scan Duration**: 23 minutes

The deprecated version of Firefox introduced a significant number of critical vulnerabilities, mainly related to known exploits and unpatched flaws.

#### Analysis:
- **Impact**: Installing outdated software increased the system's attack surface significantly, highlighting the importance of keeping software up to date.

### 3. Scan After Disabling Endpoint Firewalls
The endpoint firewall was disabled to observe the system's exposure to additional vulnerabilities.

#### Key Observations:
- **Vulnerability Severity Breakdown**:
  | Severity Level | Count  | Percentage |
  | -------------- | ------ | ---------- |
  | üü• **Critical** | 6      | 3%         |
  | üüß **High**     | 41     | 21%        |
  | üü® **Medium**   | 117    | 60%        |
  | üü© **Low**      | 31     | 16%        |

- **Scan Duration**: 23 minutes

Disabling the endpoint firewall exposed services and ports that were previously protected, leading to an increase in critical and high-risk vulnerabilities.

#### Analysis:
- **Impact**: Endpoint firewalls play a crucial role in mitigating external threats by limiting access to vulnerable services.

### 4. Scan After Removing Deprecated Firefox and Remediating Windows Vulnerabilities
The deprecated Firefox was removed, and Windows updates were applied. A final scan was conducted to verify the success of these remediation actions.
